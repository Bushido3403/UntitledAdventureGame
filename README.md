A 2D text-oriented adventure game built with C++ and SFML 3.x.

## About

Untitled Adventure Game is my C++ game featuring a custom window system with a draggable titlebar, fullscreen support, and an intuitive menu system. It's been built for my CS 135 class under Prof. Damien Ennis using a cumulation of documents from the web from sources such as StackOverflow, the SFML documentation, and various C++ programming tutorials.
