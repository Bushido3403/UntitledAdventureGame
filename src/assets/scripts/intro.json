This is Yggdrasil, the World Tree. Tonight, it is dying. One root is burning, licked by the fires of Muspelheim. Another is splintered and frozen in Jotunheim. In Midgard, the trunk groans like an old god trying not to scream. Cracks spider along the bark, and through them you glimpse realms bleeding into each other, mountains floating where there should be sea, snow falling through a summer sky. You have never seen this tree before. And yet, somehow, it feels like it is seeing you.",

Giants will rise. Fire and frost will flood the middle world.\" Images flicker in the tree's leaves:\n- A serpent choking an ocean.\n- A wolf swallowing the sun.\n- A bridge of rainbow light shattering like glass. Then you see something stranger: A single figure, small as a splinter against the vastness of Yggdrasil, standing where no mortal should stand. A mortal with no crown, no legend, no songs, just stubbornness and a shadow that leans toward all nine realms at once. The voice curls closer, wrapping around you like cold breath. \"A mortal of no renown will tip the scales,\" it says. The figure in the leaves turns. For a heartbeat, you realize: It is looking back at you.",
